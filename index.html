        <h2>
            Why am I here at BYU?
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            As I have gone throughout this semester, I have thought about this question a lot. I have always known that I wanted to come here to study at BYU, 
            and that decision has only been reinforced more and more throughout the semester. As I look at my friends that are attending other universities, 
            it is clear that BYU is different. It seems that they tend to have a strong focus on the social aspect of college, whereas we have a strong focus 
            on learning and education, presented in the light of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. So I would say that I am at BYU in order to become a 
            disciple scholar, one who serves Jesus Christ by serving others in the world. I hope to take the things I learn here and use them to benefit society 
            and bless other people.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Who do I hope to become?
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            Again, throughout the semester I have been thinking about and pondering this question. At first, and even now, I was not completely sure as to who I 
            wanted to become, at least not academically. I have always known that I hope to become a strong disciple of Jesus Christ, and act as he would. I feel 
            that throughout this semester I have had ample opportunities to develop Christlike attributes and to serve in many ways. I love that most of these 
            things have been supported by all of my classes. And now, after all of the things that I have learned throughout this semester, I know that who I want 
            to become academically goes hand in hand with who I want to become spiritually. I can be a disciple and a representative of Christ no matter what field 
            of study I go into. As long as that is my focus I know that I will succeed and be able to bless and serve others.
        </p>
        <h2>
            How can I serve others?
        </h2>
        <p class="paragraph">
            As I mentioned in the previous sections, BYU offers many opportunities to serve others. I have had assignments in classes to participate in service 
            projects, to reach out to those in need, to help others who may be struggling academically, and so on. Again, there is an extremely large emphasis at BYU 
            on making sure that our learning and education is used to serve others and help benefit them, as well as us. A very important way that I have been able to 
            serve others is through my calling in my ward. I feel that continuing to serve faithfully and help others grow their testimonies is a great act of service 
            that I have been given the opportunity to participate in. I have also been able to attend the temple a lot this semester which is another important way of 
            serving.
